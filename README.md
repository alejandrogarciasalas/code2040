# code2040
I tried making my code as reusable as possible. I tried to avoid hardcoding too many things. Validation function could be reused if json format was the same for all problems. Code fits Python3 PEP8 standards and built-in functions has been used where possible (pretty much all the problems). I did not comment most of my code because I think is pretty self explanatory.

##Usage
```
python3 [file]
```
